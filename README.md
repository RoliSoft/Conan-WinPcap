# Conan-WinPcap

Provides the [WinPcap Developer's Pack](https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm) as a [Conan](https://conan.io/) package.

Since the downloadable WDK itself only comes in a pre-compiled form, this `conanfile` does not have a build step, only package step for `Windows/x86` and `Windows/x86_64`.
